# Face Recognition using Gaussian Naive Bayes

This project implements a face recognition model using the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier on the Olivetti Faces dataset from scikit-learn. The model is evaluated based on accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. Visualizations of test predictions are also provided.

## Files and Directories

- `notebooks/face_recognition_gnb.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook to walk through the entire process.
- `src/face_recognition.py`: Python script that trains the model, evaluates it, and provides visualizations.
- `images/`: Directory to store visualizations (optional).
- `requirements.txt`: List of required libraries to run the project.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Face-Recognition-Gaussian-Naive-Bayes.git
